1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.370
I have made a lot of content around react over the years, and I get asked all the time, what is the

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.660
best way to learn react?

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.480
The answer to that is to write code, without a doubt.

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.790
So let's start off this project, right.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.020
Let's start to work on a very small project right now.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.670
Let me show you a mockup of what we're gonna try to build.

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.770
So this is what we're gonna make.

8
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.260
We're going to try to make a little English to just about any other language, text, translator.

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.990
So user is going to enter in some English text right here.

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.970
They're then going to select a language.

11
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.950
And then we're going to translate their text into that target language and display it at the very bottom.

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.540
And just you don't know.

13
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.850
We don't need to know Russian to put this project together.

14
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.750
We're going to use an outside API to actually do the translation for us.

15
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.920
But his very first project, we're going to be working on an online code editor.

16
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.110
This is a link to it right here.

17
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.630
This is the only project in this course where we will be using an online I.D. All the other projects

18
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.490
you work on will be created on your machine.

19
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.430
We're only using this online I.D. to skip over a little bit of setup and also to make use of some code

20
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.080
that I wrote out ahead of time for you.

21
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.180
Gonna take this link right here and open it up inside of a new tab inside my browser.

22
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.100
So right away, we're going to see I have file explorer on the left.

23
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.420
Code editor in the middle.

24
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.730
And then a preview window on the right hand side.

25
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.080
By default, a file should be open called app dot J.S..

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.200
If that file is not open and find it inside this SIRC folder and open it right away, we're going to

27
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.920
add all the code for this project directly into this app.

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.890
Dot J.S. file.

29
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.750
Inside of here, you're going to see a little bit of what looks like H.T. mail right away.

30
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.750
This content right here is deciding or determining what gets displayed on the preview window over here.

31
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.370
So if we change this text right here, you say either.

32
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.790
We'll see the output here on the right hand side change as well.

33
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.570
OK, so let's start to write out some code for our project.

34
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.000
I want, you know, just really quickly, we're going to write out a lot of very strange code very quickly

35
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.300
here.

36
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.810
You do not need to memorize any of the code that we're about to write out.

37
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.340
This is just a very quick demonstration and it's just kind of a jumping off point, something to give

38
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.390
us, something to talk about.

39
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.810
For the first part of this course, we're going to discuss just about all the code that we're about

40
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.070
to write in just a moment.

41
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.160
All right.

42
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.170
So here's what we're going to do at the very top of the app Dot James file.

43
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.740
We are going to add in three different import statements.

44
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.860
So I'm going to write in import field.

45
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.190
From then inside of a string, I'll put in dot slash components slash field.

46
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.270
And I'm going to say this many times throughout the course.

47
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.060
Double check your spelling of the word component's right there.

48
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.180
It is a very easy word to make a typo on there.

49
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.650
Just make sure you've got the correct typing.

50
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.050
We're now going to add in two other import statements.

51
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.890
They'll put an import languages.

52
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.680
From component's.

53
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.360
Languages.

54
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.300
And finally, translate from.

55
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.110
Component's.

56
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.780
Then down inside of this function where we've got this d'Hiv right here at present, I'm going to remove

57
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.340
that each one element.

58
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.440
So I going to highlight that whole thing and delete it.

59
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.610
And then going to show these three different components.

60
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.540
That's what these are referred to them as, components inside of this div right here.

61
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.090
And I can do so by writing out what looks like a little bit of each GMO I'm going to put in field.

62
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.020
And then a forward slash and a closing carrot.

63
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.560
I'll then do the same for languages.

64
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.940
And translate.

65
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.280
As soon as I do that, we can start to see some content up here on the right hand side.

66
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.650
And it looks awfully close to what you and I are trying to build.

67
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.700
The only element that's really missing in there is maybe that little kind of horizontal line right there,

68
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.880
which be kind of nice to have just to kind of separate these different elements.

69
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.660
So to put in a horizontal line right above translate, I'm going to write in each our like.

70
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.230
So now give me a very faint little horizontal line.

71
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.850
OK, so now we've got some content appearing on the screen, but you can see right away that nothing

72
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.070
is actually being translated.

73
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.250
And as a matter of fact, if I type something in here, I get a really nasty ear right away.

74
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.320
If you get an error like that, you can always click on this refresh button and you'll see the original

75
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.400
content start to appear.

76
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.450
So we're going to add in a little bit more configuration to each of these components.

77
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.620
And as we add in the configuration, it's going to make our applications start to come to life.

78
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.300
The coda we're about to write is also going to be a very confusing and a little bit weird.

79
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.800
Again, don't sweat it.

80
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.030
We're going to go over all this code in great detail.

81
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.440
But here's what we're gonna do up at the very top.

82
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.870
I'm going to find a import statement for react right after the word react.

83
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.830
I going to add in a coma, really races and then the word use state.

84
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.000
Then inside of my app component.

85
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.630
I going to write in concert a square bracket set of square brackets.

86
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.210
So it kind of looks like an array.

87
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.110
I'll write in language and set language.

88
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.480
Then an equals.

89
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.320
You states, and I'll pass on to that a string of are you?

90
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.350
Then on the next line down, I'm going to put in a very similar looking line.

91
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.900
So the keyword const square brackets.

92
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.870
Text set.

93
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.420
Text.

94
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.460
And I'll say you state now pass in an empty string.

95
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.550
OK, so just one more step here.

96
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.040
We're going to now take these four different variables and pass them to these three different components

97
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.950
that we're showing inside of here, just a little bit more weird code.

98
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.640
And then we'll have something really interesting being put together are actually running here.

99
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.600
The first off on field, I'm going to say label equals double quotes.

100
00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.490
Enter English.

101
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.460
I'll then put in on change equals.

102
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.690
Really, braces set.

103
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.250
Text.

104
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.880
And value equals really Brace's text.

105
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.230
OK.

106
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.180
Just two more on languages.

107
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.990
I can write in language equals early races.

108
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.780
Language.

109
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.930
Then right after that will add in on language change equals really Brace's.

110
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.140
Set language.

111
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.670
And then finally, the last little piece of text you're damn on translate.

112
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.720
We're gonna write in text is Liberalises text.

113
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.250
And language is really Brace's language.

114
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.680
And that's it.

115
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.700
Now, at this point time, we're going to test out our application on the right hand side.

116
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.420
If you get any errors, I can guarantee you that there is a typo somewhere inside of this app, dot,

117
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.090
G.S. file.

118
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.010
The code we've written inside of here is 100 percent agnostic against the version of react that we're

119
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.380
using.

120
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.880
In other words, this code is going to work for years and years and years.

121
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.440
If you get any errors whatsoever, I can guarantee you you have a typo inside this file.

122
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.740
All right.

123
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.890
Let's now do a little test over here on the right hand side.

124
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.660
I'm going to enter in a little English brace, so I'll put in something like hi there.

125
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.730
And as soon as I do, I'll then see the equivalent Russian tech start to appear at the very bottom.

126
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.680
We can then change the language, maybe go over to about Swahili.

127
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.470
There is the equivalent about Arabic.

128
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.430
There is the equivalent.

129
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.250
And well, I'd say this works out pretty well.

130
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.640
We can also change the text about how are you?

131
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.500
And there's the equivalent in Japanese.

132
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.980
And, of course, once again, we can change the target language as well.

133
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.090
OK.

134
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.290
So a fun little application, but a lot of very mysterious code here.

135
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.690
Let's take a quick pause and start to examine this code and understand what is going on in just a moment.

My name is Stephen Grider.
2

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.760
And in the next couple of hours I'm going to tell you everything I know about React and Redux. Before we dive
3

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.450
into any technical topic I want to very quickly tell you how you can get help inside this course.
4

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.630
So as we start to go through videos and write out code if you have any questions or need help troubleshooting
5

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.360
there's a couple of different ways that you can get some help.
6

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.130
First off you can reach out to me on Udemy's QA
7

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.630
discussion boards.
8

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.130
I always recommend you start there because very frequently if you're running into an issue chances are
9

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.770
someone else has as well.
10

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.130
And there might already be some posts describing how to solve the issue that you've come up with.
11

11
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.180
Second way to get in touch with me is to reach out to me on Twitter.
12

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.510
That's my handle right there.
13

13
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.430
And then finally you can also e-mail me as well.
14

14
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.060
Now a quick note here I usually answer questions on all these different forms of media between Monday
15

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.090
and Friday around 9:00 a.m. PST.
16

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.840
So if you reach out to me on like Saturday nights I may not get a response back to you until Monday
17

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.200
morning.
18

18
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.920
Just something to keep in mind.
19

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.160
OK.
20

20
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.270
So with all this in mind let's take a pause right here.
21

21
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.620
We're going to start diving in to React in the next section.
